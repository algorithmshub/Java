A Bean array is defined to be an array where for every value `n` in the array, there is also an element `n­1` or `n+1` in the array.

### Example

`{2, 10, 9, 3}` is a Bean array because:

* `2 = 3-­1`
* `10 = 9+1`
* `3 = 2+1`
* `9 = 10-­1`

Other Bean arrays include `{2, 2, 3, 3, 3}`, `{1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1}` and `{0, ­1, 1}`.

The array `{3, 4, 5, 7}` is not a Bean array because of the value `7` which requires that the array contains either the value `6` `(7­-1)` or `8` `(7+1)` but neither of these values are in the A Bunker array is defined to be an array in which at least one odd number is immediately followed by a prime number. So {4, 9, 6, 7, 3} is a Bunker array because the odd number 7 is immediately followed by the prime number 3. But {4, 9, 6, 15, 21} is not a Bunker array because none of the odd numbers are immediately followed by a prime number.array.

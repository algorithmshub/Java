# Assignment92

Consider the following algorithm.

Start with a positive number `n`:

* if `n` is even then divide by `2`
* if `n` is odd then multiply by `3` and add `1`
* continue this until `n` becomes `1`

The Guthrie sequence of a positive number `n` is defined to be the numbers generated by the above algorithm.

### Example

The Guthrie sequence of the number `7` is `7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`.

It is easy to see that this sequence was generated from the number `7` by the above algorithm:

* `7` is odd multiply by `3` and add `1` to get `22` which is the second number of the sequence
* `22` is even divide by `2` to get `11` which is the third number of the sequence
* 11 is odd so multiply by `3` and add `1` to get `34` which is the fourth number of the sequence and so on


Note that the first number of a Guthrie sequence is always the number that generated the sequence and the last number is always `1`.

Write a function named `isGuthrieSequence` that:

* returns `1` if the elements of the array form a Guthrie sequence
* otherwise it returns `0`

The function signature is `int isGuthrieSequence(int[] a)`

| if a is | return | reason |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| {8, 4, 2, 1} | 1 | this is the Guthrie sequence for 8 |
| {8, 17, 4, 1} | 0 | this is not the Guthrie sequence for 8 |
| {8, 4, 1} | 0 | missing the 2 |
| {8, 4, 2} | 0 | a Guthrie sequence must end with 1 |

### Solution

```java
public class Assignment92 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int result = isGuthrieSequence(new int[]{8, 4, 2, 1});
    System.out.println(result);

    result = isGuthrieSequence(new int[]{8, 17, 4, 1});
    System.out.println(result);

    result = isGuthrieSequence(new int[]{8, 4, 1});
    System.out.println(result);

    result = isGuthrieSequence(new int[]{8, 4, 2});
    System.out.println(result);
  }

  static int isGuthrieSequence(int[] a) {
    if (a[a.length - 1] != 1) {
      return 0;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < a.length - 1; i++) {
      if (a[i] % 2 == 0) {
        if (a[i + 1] != (a[i] / 2)) {
          return 0;
        }
      } else {
        if (a[i + 1] != ((a[i] * 3) + 1)) {
          return 0;
        }
      }
    }

    return 1;
  }
}
```

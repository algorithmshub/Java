# Assignment12

Consider the following algorithm.

Start with a positive number `n`:

* if `n` is even then divide by `2`
* if `n` is odd then multiply by `3` and add `1`
* continue this until n becomes `1`

The Guthrie index of a positive number `n` is defined to be how many iterations of the above algorithm it takes before `n` becomes `1`.

For example, the Guthrie index of the number `7` is `16` because the following sequence is `16` numbers long. `22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`.

It is easy to see that this sequence was generated by the above algorithm. Since `7` is odd multiply by `3` and add `1` to get `22` which is the first number of the sequence. Since `22` is even, divide by `2` to get `11` which is the second number of the sequence. `11` is odd so multiply by `3` and add `1` to get `34` which is the third number of the sequence and so on.

Write a function named `guthrieIndex` which computes the Guthrie index of its argument.

Its signature is `int guthrieIndex(int n)`

| if n is | return | sequence |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 1 | 0 | number is already 1 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 7 | 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 |
| 4 | 2 | 2, 1 |
| 42 | 8 | 21, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 |

### Solution

```java
public class Assignment12 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int result = guthrieIndex(1);
    System.out.println(result);

    result = guthrieIndex(2);
    System.out.println(result);

    result = guthrieIndex(3);
    System.out.println(result);

    result = guthrieIndex(4);
    System.out.println(result);

    result = guthrieIndex(42);
    System.out.println(result);
  }

  static int guthrieIndex(int n) {
    int guthrieIndex = 0;

    if (n > 1) {
      while (n != 1) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
          n /= 2;
        } else {
          n = n * 3 + 1;
        }
        guthrieIndex++;
      }
    }

    return guthrieIndex;
  }
}
```

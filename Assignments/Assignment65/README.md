A primeproduct is a positive integer that is the product of exactly two primes greater than `1`.

For example, `22` is primeproduct since `22=2` times `11` and both `2` and `11` are primes greater than `1`.

Write a function named `isPrimeProduct` with an integer parameter that:

* returns `1` if the parameter is a primeproduct
* otherwise it returns `0`

Recall that a prime number is a positive integer with no factors other than `1` and itself.

You may assume that there exists a function named `isPrime(int m)` that:

* returns `1` if its `m` is a prime number
* otherwise it returns `0`

You do not need to write isPrime. You are allowed to use this function.

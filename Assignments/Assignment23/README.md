# Assignment23

Consider the prime number `11`. Note that `13` is also a prime and `13 â€“ 11 = 2`. So, `11` and `13` are known as twin primes.

Similarly, `29` and `31` are twin primes. So is `71` and `73`.

However, there are many primes for which there is no twin, examples are `23`, `67`. A twin array is defined to an array which every prime that has a twin appear with a twin.

Some examples are:

* `{3, 5, 8, 10, 27}`, `3` and `5` are twins and both are present
* `{11, 9, 12, 13, 23}`, `11` and `13` are twins and both are present, `23` has no twin
* `{5, 3, 14, 7, 18, 67}`, `3` and `5` are twins, `5` and `7` are twins, `67` has no twin

The following are NOT twin arrays:

* `{13, 14, 15, 3, 5}` `13` has a twin prime and it is missing in the array
* `{1, 17, 8, 25, 67}` `17` has a twin prime and it is missing in the array

Write a function named `isTwin(int[] arr)` that

* returns `1` if its array argument is a Twin array
* otherwise it return `0`
